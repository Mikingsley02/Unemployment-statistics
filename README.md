# Unemployment statistics
The term unemployment refers to a situation where a person actively searches for employment but cannot find work. Unemployment is considered a vital measure of the economy's health.
Unemployment is a key economic indicator because it signals the ability (or inability) of workers to obtain gainful work and contribute to the productive output of the economy. More unemployed workers mean less total economic production.
